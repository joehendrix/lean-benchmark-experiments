# Lean Benchmarking Tester

This is a small experimental repo to show how to benchmark operations in
Lean.

To build it, you should install `elan` and make sure you have the
prover version `leanprover-lean4-nightly-2021-03-14`.

Once this is installed, you can run the benchmark by running the shell script `./run.sh`.
